1- After remove duplicate UMIs have a bam file


2- Sort bam file
	$ samtools sort rmv_dup_alignment.bam rmv_dup_alignment.sorted


3- Determine alignment per basepair with -d 
	$ bedtools genomecov -d -ibam rmv_dup_alignment.sorted.bam -g /vol3/home/jhessel/ref/genomes/hg19/hg19 > output6.bed  


4- Put all Chr21 bp alignments into one file
	$ grep -w chr21 output6.bed > bpchr21.bed


5- Put all of Chr21 bp that had 0 alignments into one file
	$ grep -w 0$ bpchr21.bed > bpzerochr21.bed


6- Count the number of lines in both the chr21 bp alignment (output6.bed) and the chr21 0 alignment file (bpzeriochr21.bed)
	$ wc -l <file>

7- Move reads that had >0 alignments to a file
	$ awk '$3>0' bpchr21.bed > bpchr21grtzero.bed
